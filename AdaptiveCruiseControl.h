 * accordingly. The class also supports console display and basic logging to a

/**
 * @class AdaptiveCruiseControl
 * @brief Simplified adaptive cruise control logic and telemetry logging.
 *
 * This class encapsulates the state and behavior of a basic ACC system:
 * - Tracks ego vehicle speed, ahead vehicle speed, and inter-vehicle distance
 * - Computes the safe following distance per the 2-second rule
 * - Adjusts ego speed to maintain a comfortable, capped, and safe gap
 * - Displays status to console and persists snapshots to a plain-text log file
